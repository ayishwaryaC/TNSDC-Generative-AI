Handwritten Model using GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) - Colab Edition

Overview:

This repository contains code for training and using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate handwritten characters. The model is trained on a dataset of handwritten characters to generate realistic-looking handwritten characters. This version is tailored for Google Colab, allowing for easy setup and execution in a cloud-based environment.

Requirements:

1.Google account (for accessing Google Colab)
2.Internet connection
3.Basic knowledge of Python and TensorFlow
4.Python 3.x
5.TensorFlow (>=2.0)
6.NumPy
7.Matplotlib

Dataset: 

The dataset used for training the GAN consists of handwritten characters. You can use any dataset containing handwritten characters, such as MNIST or custom datasets. If you're using a custom dataset, make sure to upload it to your Google Drive and adjust the file paths accordingly.

Usage:

Training : Open and execute the train.ipynb notebook to train the GAN model. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to configure the training process.
Generating Handwritten Characters : Once the model is trained, open and execute the generate.ipynb notebook to generate handwritten characters using the trained model.
Testing and Evaluation : You can evaluate the quality of generated images using different evaluation metrics and visualize the results using the provided notebooks.

Model Architecture:

The GAN model consists of a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator generates realistic-looking handwritten characters, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated handwritten characters.
